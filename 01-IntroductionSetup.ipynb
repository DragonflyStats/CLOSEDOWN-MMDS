It provides alternative methods for finding neighbors, integrates a fast search method, and introduces a novel and experimental application of randomForest. \n\nA function for computing the error statistics suggested by Stage and Crookston (2007) is also included. \n\nWe anticipate that progress in this field will continue, particularly in the area of discovering better X-variables and transformations improving the essential requirements for applying these methods: that there be a relationship between the X- and Y -variables.\n "
